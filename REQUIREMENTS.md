## Requirements and Dependencies

The testing approach and the drone model are written in Python (you can find the python releases [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).
They were written and tested using Python 3.11.
You will also need some common Python packages: numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.
You can install them with the following command:
```
pip3 install numpy scipy matplotlib
```

The generate data for the full Crazyflie testing campaign take about 35Gb.
