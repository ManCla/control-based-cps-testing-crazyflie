## Requirements and Dependencies

The testing approach and the drone model are written in Python (you can find the python releases [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).
They were written and tested using Python 3.11.
You will also need some common Python packages: numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.
You can install them with the following command:
```
    pip3 install numpy==1.24.1
    pip3 install scipy==1.10.0
    pip3 install matplotlib==3.8.2
```

The packages have been tested with the versions reported in the commands.

The data generated for the full Crazyflie testing campaign take about 35Gb.
